This repository contains whatever code and writings I want to make publicly
available.  As the name suggests, this is mostly my research into various
programming languages or code paradigms.  Probably if it were production-quality
code, I would release it as its own project, so the fact that it is here means
that it needs serious work before it can be used for anything.  Really, I mean
it.  Don't use this code unless you've checked and fixed it thoroughly.

Code and text are best viewed in a monospace font with line width set to 80
characters and with tab stops set to 4 spaces.

I hope you find these materials useful and educational.
