# LiSP

This is my attempt to turn each of the chapters of Christian Queinnec's excellent book *Lisp in Small Pieces* into
a working (albeit very limited) interpreter. It's mostly for my own education but perhaps someone will find it
useful.

For the uninitiated, *LiSP* is split into 11 Chapters. Each chapter implements a interpreter/compiler for a
Scheme-like language. As such, this repo will hopefully contain 11 working interpreter/compilers. *LiSP* also 
contains exercises which suggest modifications to the interpreters/compilers, which I will implement, so there may
actually be more than 11 interpreters/compilers.

A lot of the code here will be directly out of *LiSP*. I believe this to be fair use, as I am never going to make any
money off it and Christian Queinnic himself has made the code freely available on [this
page](http://pagesperso-systeme.lip6.fr/Christian.Queinnec/WWW/LiSP.html).
