References
----------
This implementation is influenced by John Shutt's work on
the Kernel programming language, especially the way it evaluates
(arguments don't evaluate by default). The relevant dissertation
can be found [here](https://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/ETD/Available/etd-090110-124904/unrestricted/jshutt.pdf).
